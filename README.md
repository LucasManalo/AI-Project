# Project Name

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have all required packages by installing from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Save Your OpenAI Key**  
   Set up your OpenAI API key by saving it in your environment. You can do this by adding your key to an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
   ```

   Alternatively, you can store it in a configuration file if your code supports that approach.

## Usage

- **Generate Concepts**  
  To generate initial concepts, run:

  ```bash
  python concept_generator.py
  ```

- **Filter Concepts**  
  After generating concepts, you can filter them using:

  ```bash
  python concept_filterer.py
  ```

- **Train the Model**  
  To begin model training, execute:

  ```bash
  python train.py
  ```

- **Test the Model**  
  Once the model is trained, test its performance by running:

  ```bash
  python test.py
  ```

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Stores data files (ignored in version control).
- `models/`: Stores model files (ignored in version control).
- `myenv/`: Environment folder, typically for virtual environments (ignored in version control).
- `src/`: contains all python code associated with generating and testing the label-free concept bottleneck model

## Notes
- Ensure that all required packages are installed and the API key is set up properly before running the scripts.
- You may need to adjust paths in the scripts if you modify the folder structure.
